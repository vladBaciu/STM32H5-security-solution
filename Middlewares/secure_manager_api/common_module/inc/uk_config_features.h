 * @brief         uKernel API - uKernel Features definitions.

 * @maintainer    patrice.hameau@provenrun.com
 * @ingroup       uKernelAPI
 ******************************************************************************
 * @details
 * This file contains the uKernel Features exposed in the uKernel API for the
 *  uKernel Target used.
 * A uKernel Feature is a defined C-Preprocessor statement representing the
 *  support (when defined) of a uKernel functionality or of a specific variant
 *  of uKernel implementation (optimized for speed, resources, ...).
 *
 * The purpose of having some of these uKernel Features be part of the uKernel
 *  API is because they may be of interest for:
 *  - ukApp code: they allow to adapt and fine tune the ukApp implementation
 *   (e.g. by using conditional compilation) by relying on the uKernel
 *   functionalities effectively supported by the uKernel Target used.
 *  - ukApp configuration: they allow to adapt the configuration of the ukApp
 *   in their ukApp Descriptors in function of uKernel Features effectively
 *   supported (e.g. available resources consistent with supported
 *   functionalities).
 *
 * Example of uKernel Features:
 *  - uKernel built for Production Target.
 *  - uKernel Scheduler specific behavior.
 *  - uKernel support of ukProc Debug functionalities.
 *  - ...
 *
 * This file is part of the ukApp SDK and is specific to a given uKernel
 *  Release.
 *
 * @robustness The uKernel Features are taken into account only during the
 *  compilation of the uKernel Release used. It enforces that the
 *  implementation code relative to the uKernel functionalities
 *  associated to a uKernel Feature is included in uKernel Target binary only
 *  when supported (this participates to minimize the attack surface of the
 *  uKernel). The consistency of the uKernel Features supported is enforced
 *  during the compilation of the uKernel Release.
 *
 * @warning This file is specific to a given uKernel Target.
 * This file SHALL NOT BE MODIFIED.
 * It shall be used only for compiling and linking ukApp aiming at running on
 *  this given uKernel Target.
 * If improper version is used, the ukApp proper execution cannot be
 *  guaranteed. However, the ukApp security properties, and notably its
 *  isolation, remain always enforced even in case an improper version is used.

 *
 * If this uKernel Feature is supported, then the following uKernel
 *  functionalities will be supported:
 *   - Implementation of the ukApp Entry Point ukappCleanup() in ukApp.
 *    The definition of this ukApp Entry Point is optional in the ukApp code of

 *   - Invocation of the ukApp Entry Point ukappCleanup() by the uKernel, if

 * The uKernel Image Update support provides the necessary functionalities to
 *  allow a ukProc to perform a partial or complete update of the current
 *  uKernel Image (composed of uKernel core code, and ukApps Bundle containing
 *  all the code and configuration of the ukApps).
 * The uKernel Image Update process is performed as follows:

 *   Update Storage (a dedicated reserved part of the MCU Flash).
 *  - Verifying the integrity and structure validity of the uKernel Image
 *   Updated Part.
 *  - Replacing with the provided uKernel Image Updated Part whole or part of
 *   the uKernel Image. This replacement is done only at the startup of a new
 *   uKernel Session after a uKernel Session End of the current one (i.e. the
 *   uKernel Session has been terminated without any errors).
 *
 * If this uKernel Feature is supported, then the following uKernel
 *  functionalities will be supported:
 *   - Erasing blocks of the uKernel Image Update Storage (see

 *   - Reading and Writing blocks data in the uKernel Image Update Storage (see

 *
 * Definition of the uKernel Feature for allowing the support for keeping

 *
 * This uKernel Feature act on the uKernel Security Policy for uKernel Image
 *  Update as follows:
 *  - SUPPORTED:  When replacing a uKernel Image part (see
 *   ukUKImageUpdateOperate()), a copy of the replaced part is stored in
 *   uKernel Image Update Storage. This copy can be used to perform a roll-back
 *   to the previous version of the uKernel Image part updated.
 *  The default uKernel Security Policy is to trigger the roll-back to the
 *   previous version if after a certain consecutive count (see
 *   DukCONFIG_OPTION_UKERNEL_IMAGE_UPDATE_VALIDATE_SESSION_COUNT_MAX)
 *   of consecutive uKernel Sessions, the uKernel Image Update Operation
 *   DukUKERNEL_IMAGE_UPDATE_OPERATION_VALIDATE has not been performed. The
 *   roll-back is performed by the uKernel Bootloader before the start of the
 *   uKernel Session.
 *  The uKernel Image Update Storage keeps the previous version until the
 *   the uKernel Image Update Operation
 *   DukUKERNEL_IMAGE_UPDATE_OPERATION_UNLOCK_STORAGE is performed. While
 *   keeping the previous version, the uKernel Image Update Storage is locked
 *   and cannot be used for storing a new uKernel Image part for update.
 *  The roll-back can also be triggered by the ukApp code itself (see
 *   DukUKERNEL_IMAGE_UPDATE_OPERATION_ROLLBACK) as long as the uKernel Image
 *   Update Storage is locked.
 *  - NOT SUPPORTED: When replacing a uKernel Image part (see
 *   ukUKImageUpdateOperate()), no copy of the replaced part is kept in
 *   uKernel Image Update Storage, and thus it is not possible to roll-back
 *   to the previous version after having triggered the update.

/**
 * @brief uKernel Feature defining the support of Debug LED for reporting
 *  debug information.
 *
 * Definition of the uKernel Feature for the support of the Debug LED for
 *  reporting debug information.
 *
 * A Debug LED is an indicator light (often a LED component is used indeed)
 *  that can be switched ON or OFF, possibly with a specific blinking pattern,
 *  to report a given information.
 * Each Debug LED is connected to one of the GPIO line of the MCU (and thus
 *  this GPIO line cannot be used anymore by applicative code in ukApp). The
 *  convention being that when the GPIO line is providing Vcc voltage level,
 *  the Debug LED is switched ON.
 *
 * The Debug LEDs can be used by:
 *  - The uKernel to report its internal state, and notably the following
 *   information:
 *    + uKernel Initialization ongoing.
 *    + uKernel Initialization failure.
 *    + uKernel FATAL Error (after its Initialization).
 *    + A ukProc Fatal Error.
 *    + uKernel Scheduler entering Idle Mode (no Schedulable ukProc available).
 *    + uKernel entering Low Power Mode.
 *  - A ukProc to report various information relative to its internal state
 *   (life-cycle, error, ...). The way to use the Debug LED, to report
 *   information with specific blinking pattern, is let open to the ukApp
 *   developer.
 *
 * @warning The GPIO lines (i.e. GPIO port and given pin) used as Debug LED
 *  are set up during uKernel Initialization. But their configuration is
 *  afterwards not protected by the uKernel: thus if a ukProc modifies the
 *  GPIO port configuration (e.g. cut the GPIO clock, ...), the Debug LED may
 *  not work anymore as expected. The reason why not to prevent such
 *  modifications is that, as GPIO port configuration implies various internal
 *  hardware modules in the MCU, it would have implied to much restrictions or
 *  modifications in the ukApp code to offer relative level of confidence on a
 *  uKernel Feature that is only for debug purpose.
 *
 * @note The implementation of the Debug LED management is performed very
 *  quickly, and thus should only affect slightly the uKernel execution speed.
 *  It should however be kept in mind that this change of execution speed, even
 *  if small, may result in different behaviors of the ukProcs executed,
 *  notably in regards of external events.
 *
 * Default: DEFINED.
 * Production Release: Forced to NOT DEFINED.
