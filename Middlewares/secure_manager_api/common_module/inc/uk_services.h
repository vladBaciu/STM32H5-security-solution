 /**
 * @brief C-Function triggering a ukProc Exit.
 *
 * This C-Function triggers a ukProc Exit to halt definitively the execution of
 *  current ukProc Instance.
 * The ukProc Exit can be triggered only by the ukApp code itself through the
 *  invocation of this uKernel Privileged Service in one of its ukApp Entry
 *  Point.
 *
 * The ukProc Exit of a ukApp Entry Point is managed by the uKernel as follows
 *  upon invocation of this uKernel Privileged Service:
 * - Invocation from ukApp Entry Point ukappMain() or ukappException():
 *  + The given boolean parameter <is_exit_in_error__i> indicates the nature
 *    of the ukProc Exit:
 *   * DukBOOL_FALSE: Successful end of all the operations of the ukProc
 *      Instance (i.e without reporting any error), which leads to a ukProc
 *      End. The ukProc Termination Reason is set to
 *      DukUKPROC_TERMINATION_REASON_END.
 *   * (other value): An erroneous internal condition during the operations
 *      of the ukProc Instance has been spotted by the ukApp implementation,
 *      which leads to a ukProc Abort.
 *      The ukProc Termination Reason is set to
 *      DukUKPROC_TERMINATION_REASON_ABORT_EXIT_IN_ERROR.
 *  + The given ukProc Termination Info <ukproc_termination_info__i> is
 *    stored in the ukProc Termination Context of the ukApp from which has
 *    been instantiated the current ukProc Instance.
 *
 * - Invocation from ukApp Entry Point ukappCleanup():
 *  + The given boolean parameter <is_exit_in_error__i> indicates the success
 *    of the ukProc Cleanup process:
 *   * DukBOOL_FALSE: ukProc Cleanup process is successful.
 *   * (other value): ukProc Cleanup process is unsuccessful.
 *   Note that the value of the given boolean parameter does not affect the
 *   ukProc Termination Reason (i.e. the value set upon the triggering of the
 *   ukProc Termination process is kept).
 *  + The given ukProc Termination Info <ukproc_termination_info__i> is
 *    ignored.
 *
 * Following a ukProc Exit, the uKernel always triggers a ukProc Termination,
 *  which leads to the deletion of the current ukProc Instance.
 *
 * See ukProc Management documentation for:
 *  - Details on ukProc End:
 *   + @ref docUKProcManagementEnd
 *  - Details on ukProc Abort:
 *   + @ref docUKProcManagementAbort
 *  - Details on ukProc Termination:
 *   + @ref docUKProcManagementTermination
 *
 * @implementation This uKernel Privileged Service, for sure, never returns!
 *
 * @implementation If the uKernel Feature
 *  SukCONFIG_FEATURE_UKPROC_TERMINATION_ALLOWED is not defined, then invoking
 *  this uKernel Privileged Service will trigger during the ukProc Terminate
 *  process a uKernel Session End with Status Code
 *  DukSTATUS_ERR_UKPROC_TERMINATED, followed by an MCU Reset.
 *
 * @implementation Some additional actions defined in the uKernel Security
 *  Policy may be taken by the uKernel upon a ukProc Exit:
 *   - Analysis the occurrence of such events.
 *   - Report externally the ukProc Exit.
 *   - Prevent further creation of ukProc Instance from the same ukApp.
 *   - Trigger a uKernel Session End (see DukPLATFORM_ATTRIBUTE_TAG_STATE).
 *   - ...
 *
 * @usage This uKernel Privileged Service should be used to end the execution
 *  of a ukProc Instance that needs to be executed only spuriously.
 *
 * @usage This uKernel Privileged Service SHALL BE used to report the detection
 *  of an erroneous internal condition spotted by ukApp implementation during
 *  the operations of its ukProc Instance. This report will allow the uKernel
 *  to retrieve proper associated contextual information and to apply more
 *  efficiently defined uKernel Security Policy.
 *
 * @usage Following a ukProc Exit, the ukProc Termination Context is set with
 *  the information on the termination of the ukProc Instance. This information
 *  can be retrieved using the ukApp Attribute Tag
 *  DukUKAPP_ATTRIBUTE_TAG_UKPROC_TERMINATION_CONTEXT_LAST.

 * This C-Function returns from a ukApp Entry Point part of the ukApp code.

/**
 * @brief C-Function yielding current ukProc.
 *
 * This C-Function yields the current ukProc in ukScheduler (uKernel Scheduler)
 *  during at least the given Yield Delay <yield_delay_systick__i> in uKernel
 *  SysTicks unit.
 *
 * A Yielded ukProc is set immediately in Scheduling ukProc State Blocked-Yield
 *  in the ukScheduler during at least the given Yield Delay
 *  <yield_delay_systick__i> in uKernel SysTicks unit.
 * As long as the ukProc is in Scheduling ukProc State Blocked-Yield, it is
 *  unschedulable and thus cannot be elected as the Scheduled ukProc.
 *
 * The management of a Yielded ukProc by the ukScheduler depends of the value
 *  of the given Yield Delay <yield_delay_systick__i>:
 *  - Null(0):
 *   + The Scheduling Time Quantum Remaining of the Yielded ukProc is reset to
 *     null(0) in the current Active Scheduling Window. It is thus
 *     unschedulable in the current Active Scheduling Window.
 *   + Once the current Active Scheduling Window is over, that is when all the
 *     other ukProcs in Scheduling ukProc State Ready have their Scheduling
 *     Time Quantum exhausted (i.e. their Scheduling Time Quantum Remaining
 *     having reached null(0)), the Yielded ukProc will have its Scheduling
 *     Time Quantum Remaining reset to its Scheduling Time Quantum Allocated
 *     value, and is again schedulable in the new current Active Scheduling
 *     Window.
 *  - Not null(<>0):
 *   + The Yielded ukProc is set in in Scheduling ukProc State Blocked-Yield.
 *     It remains in this Scheduling ukProc State, and thus unschedulable, as
 *     long as the given Yield Delay <yield_delay_systick> is not over.
 *   + Once the given Yield Delay is over, the Yielded ukProc will have its
 *     Scheduling ukProc State set back to Ready.
 *     Note that it does not implies it will be immediately elected as the
 *     Scheduled ukProc (as it depends of the current Scheduling ukProc State
 *     and Scheduling Properties of the other ukProcs).
 *
 * @implementation In case no schedulable ukProc remains after the current
 *  ukProc being yielded (i.e. none of the ukProcs have their Scheduling ukProc
 *  State set to Ready), then the ukScheduler Idle mode becomes active (the
 *  ukScheduler elects as Scheduled uKproc a virtual ukProc Idle).
 *  The ukScheduler Idle mode remains active until at least an Instantiated
 *  ukProc is marked again as schedulable (one of them to being then elected
 *  as the new Scheduled ukProc) due to:
 *  - The Yield Delay of at least one ukProc in Scheduling ukProc State
 *   Blocked-Yield is over.
 *  - The Timeout of at least one ukProc in Scheduling ukProc State Blocked-IPC
 *   is over.
 *  - The occurrence of an external event (e.g. triggering of a Peripheral IRQ)
 *   expected by at least one ukProc in Scheduling ukProc State Blocked-IPC or
 *   Blocked-FLASH.
 *
 * @usage If this uKernel Privileged Service is invoked while in the ukApp

 *  with ukProc Termination Reason
