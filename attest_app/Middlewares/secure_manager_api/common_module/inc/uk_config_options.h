 * @brief         uKernel API - uKernel Options definitions.

 * @maintainer    patrice.hameau@provenrun.com
 * @ingroup       uKernelAPI
 ******************************************************************************
 * @details
 * This configuration file contains the uKernel Options exposed in the uKernel
 *  API for the uKernel Target used.
 * A uKernel Option is a constant value representing a uKernel internal
 *  parameter used during its compilation, and whose value is defining limits,
 *  constraints, or choices on the uKernel functionalities and behaviors.
 *
 * The purpose of having some of these uKernel Options be part of the uKernel
 *  API is that they may be of interest for:
 *  - ukApp code: they allow to adapt and fine tune the ukApp implementation
 *   by using the same C-Constant parameters definitions than the ones of the
 *   uKernel Target used.
 *  - ukApp configuration: they provide some constraints global to the uKernel
 *   System and to each ukApp. These constrains may be needed to fill
 *   consistently ukApp Descriptors (e.g. available resources consistent with
 *   what is needed by ukApps present in ukAppq Bundle).
 *
 * Example of uKernel Options:
 *  - Maximal length of ukProc NTString Name.
 *  - Maximal number of ukApps and ukProcs.
 *  - Limit for Scheduling Priority and maximal Scheduled Duration.
 *  - ...
 *
 * This file is part of the ukApp SDK and is specific to a given uKernel
 *  Target.
 *
 * @robustness The uKernel Options are taken into account only during the
 *  compilation of the uKernel Target used. It enforces that internal checks
 *  relative to the uKernel parameters related to the uKernel Options are
 *  'hard-coded' in a uKernel Target code (this participates to minimize the
 *  attack surface of the uKernel).
 *
 * @warning This file is specific to a given uKernel Target.
 * This file SHALL NOT BE MODIFIED.
 * It shall be used only for compiling and linking ukApp aiming at running on
 *  this given uKernel Target.
 * If improper version is used, the ukApp proper execution cannot be
 *  guaranteed. However, the ukApp security properties, and notably its
 *  isolation, remain always enforced even in case an improper version is used.
 *
 * @implementation The uKernel Options definitions specific to given Platform
 *  elements are defined in separate files. The main entry configuration file
 *  for these definitions is the file "uk_config_options_hw_mcu_device.h",
 *  containing the master definitions relative to the MCU Device selected for
 *  the uKernel Target.
 *  This configuration file "uk_config_options_hw_mcu_device.h" is
 *  selected for inclusion by adding the following directory in the compiler
 *  include files configuration:
 *   "ukernel_api/target/<target>/uk/include/config/hw/mcu/device/<vendor>/<family>/<device>"
 *  This directory, which is set only in the configuration of the compiler
 *  include files (no reference in source code), is built using the following
 *  directory definitions (all in lower case):
 *   - <target>: Target Name
 *     Eclipse Build Variable: BVukTARGET_NAME__lc
 *   - <vendor>: Device vendor shortname
 *     Eclipse Build Variable: BVukTARGET_HW_MCU_VENDOR__lc
 *   - <family>: Device family shortname
 *     Eclipse Build Variable: BVukTARGET_HW_MCU_FAMILY__lc
 *   - <device>: Device name
 *     Eclipse Build Variable: BVukTARGET_HW_MCU_DEVICE__lc
 *
 * @implementation During uKernel compilation for a given uKernel Target
 *  <target>, the "uk_config_options.h" file is placed in the directory
 *  "ukernel_api/target/<target>/uk/include/config/".
 *
 * @usage The uKernel Options part of the uKernel API that are specific to a
 *  given Platform SHALL BE defined in Platform specific files under directory
 *  "ukernel_api/target/<target>/uk/include/config/hw/mcu/..." for a uKernel
 *  Target <target>.
 *
 * @usage This file SHALL BE included only after the "uk_config_features.h"
 *  include file.

/**
 * @brief uKernel Option C-Constant defining the default uKernel SysTick
 *  period in us.
 *
 * Definition of the uKernel Option C-Constant for the default uKernel SysTick
 *  period value in microseconds (us).
 * The uKernel SysTick period is used as unit for all Scheduling Time Quantum
 *  used by the ukScheduler (uKernel Scheduler).
 *
 * @robustness To enforce uKernel internal consistency of time measurements (as
 *  well as for the ukApp), the uKernel SysTick period remains fixed during a
 *  whole uKernel Session.
 *  If the uKernel SysTick period is updated by a ukProc, it will be taken
 *  into account only upon the next uKernel Session.
 *
 * @warning The value given shall result in a valid configuration for the MCU
 *  Device used when combined with the MCU Clock Frequency defined by CPU
 *  Clock Index 0 (see DukCONFIG_OPTION_HW_MCU_CLOCK_PARAMETERS_TABLE). In
 *  case an invalid configuration is detected, the uKernel Initialization will
 *  fail with Fatal Error.
 *
 * @note The indicative supported range values given may be reduced due to
 *  hardware limitation of the MCU Device used in the Platform (see MCU
 *  documentation) and selected MCU Clocks supported by the uKernel.
 *
 * @implementation In case MCU Clocks are updated, the uKernel will perform
 *  the necessary internal adjustments to keep the period for the uKernel
 *  SysTick constant during a uKernel Session.
 *
 * @usage It is advised of not having a too long uKernel SysTick period value
 *  in order to keep efficient responsiveness between ukProcs. Thus this value
 *  SHOULD BE defined to the maximal acceptable response time when several
 *  ukProcs need to share concurrent executions.
 *
 * @usage This value is the default value used during first uKernel Session.
 *  It can be updated by a ukProc with appropriate credentials by using
 *  uKernel Privileged Services (the updated value being taking into account
 *  only for the following uKernel Sessions).
 *
 * Default value: 10000us (10ms)
 * Supported values: [500 ... 1000000].

 *
 * @robustness It is the only memory area of the ukApp to which the uKernel
 *  can get access to (read / write) once ukProc execution has started. The
 *  uKernel core cannot have access (enforced by hardware restrictions) to the
 *  other data in the other sub-areas of the ukApp Data Volatile Block once

 *
 * The total count of Shared Buffers is obtained by adding the count of Shared
 *  Buffers defined in each ukApp present in the ukApps Bundle.
 *  The count of Shared Buffer in a ukApp is defined in the field
 *  <SharedBufferDescriptorCount> of its ukApp Descriptor.
 *
 * @robustness The uKernel Initialization checks that this maximum value
 *  is consistent (i.e. superior) with the total count of Shared Buffers.
 *  Else the uKernel Initialization will fail.
 *  The purpose of this check is to enforce that no race condition may occur
 *  due to lack of resources during ukProc execution.
 *
 * @implementation The maximal number of Shared Buffers that can be defined per
 *  ukApp is defined independently by
 *  DukCONFIG_OPTION_UKAPP_SHAREDBUFFER_DESCRIPTOR_COUNT_MAX.
 *
 * @implementation As all the ukApps are not needing to use Shared Buffers,
 *  this value allows to minimize the uKernel RAM memory consumption needed
 *  for managing internally the Shared Buffers.
 *  Each Shared Buffer supported requires ~20 bytes of uKernel RAM memory.
 *
 * @implementation The maximal number of Shared Buffer CANNOT BE higher than
 *  DukCONSTRAINT_SHAREDBUFFER_COUNT_MAX.
