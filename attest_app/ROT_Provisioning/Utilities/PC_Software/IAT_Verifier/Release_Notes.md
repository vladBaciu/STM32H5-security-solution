# Purpose

The purpose of the IAT verifier utility is to provide a means of **verifying the Integrity Attestation Token (IAT)** generated by Trusted Firmware-M (TF-M) or the Secure Manager. The tool helps to ensure that the IAT is valid and has been **signed by a trusted entity**, thereby attesting to the **integrity** of the firmware image. The IAT Verifier utility is an essential component in the security infrastructure of a system that uses TF-M or Secure Manager and helps to prevent unauthorized access and tampering of the firmware.
